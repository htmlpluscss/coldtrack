			5. Confidentiality
		</h2>

		<h3>
			5.1 Confidential Information.
		</h3>

		<p>
			From time to time, either party (the "Disclosing Party") may disclose or make available to the other party (the "Receiving Party") non-public, proprietary, and confidential information of the Disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”). Confidential Information includes any information that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, including non-public business, product, technology and marketing information ("Confidential Information"). Confidential Information does not include any information that: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of the Receiving Party's breach of this confidentiality section; (b) is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party source, provided that such third party is not and was not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information; (c) was in the Receiving Party's possession prior to the Disclosing Party's disclosure hereunder; or (d) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without using any of the Disclosing Party Confidential Information.
		</p>

		<h3>
			5.2 Protection and Use of Confidential Information.
		</h3>

		<p>
			The Receiving Party shall: (a) protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Receiving Party would protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially reasonable degree of care; (b) not use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, or permit it to be accessed or used, for any purpose other than to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under these Terms; and (c) not disclose any such Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the Receiving Party's service providers or financial/legal advisors who need to know the Confidential Information and are bound to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in these Terms.
		</p>

		<h3>
			5.3 Compelled Access or Disclosure.
		</h3>

		<p>
			If the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, it shall, prior to making such disclosure, use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Disclosing Party of such requirements to afford the Disclosing Party the opportunity to seek, at the Disclosing Party's sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy.
		</p>

		<h2>

		<h2>
			12. Terms of Paid Subscriptions
		</h2>

		<p>
			If you purchase a subscription to the Services via the ColdStack website (“Online Subscription”) or pursuant to any ordering document (“Order Form Subscription”), the following terms of subscription will apply to you:
		</p>

		<h3>
			12.1 Subscription Term
		</h3>

		<p>
			The Services are provided on a subscription basis for a term defined in the Online Subscription, or on the Order Form Subscription, as applicable (each, a “Subscription Term”).
		</p>

		<h3>
			12.2 Cancellation
		</h3>

		<p>
			You may cancel your subscription at any time; however, you are responsible for advance payment of the entire Subscription Term. Fees are non-refundable based on the Subscription Term purchased and not actual usage. Payment obligations for the Subscription Term to which you subscribe are noncancelable.
		</p>

		<h3>
			12.3 Renewals
		</h3>

		<p>
			For Online Subscriptions, each Subscription Term will automatically renew for an additional Subscription Term equal in length to the original Subscription Term. Online Subscriptions can be cancelled directly at <a href="https://сoldstack.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.сoldstack.io</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			For Order Form Subscriptions, each Subscription Term will automatically renew for an additional Subscription Term equal in length to the original Subscription Term, unless cancellation is requested in writing (including by email to <a href="mailto:support@сoldstack.io">support@сoldstack.io</a>) at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current Subscription Term.
		</p>

		<h3>
			12.4 Billing and Payment
		</h3>

		<p>
			If you purchase a subscription to the Services via credit card, debit card or other payment card (collectively, “Credit Card”), you hereby authorize ColdStack (or its designee) to automatically charge your Credit Card in accordance with the applicable Online Subscription or Order Form Subscription. You acknowledge that certain Credit Cards may charge you foreign transaction fees or other charges. If your payment is not successfully settled for any reason, you remain responsible for any amounts not remitted to ColdStack. Each net new user beyond the scope of the initial Online Subscription or Order Form Subscription, as applicable, will incur an additional charge, and will be included in a true-up invoice or charged automatically via Credit Card, as applicable.
		</p>

		<h3>
			12.5 Late Payments
		</h3>

		<p>
			Any late payments shall be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less (plus the costs of collection). ColdStack may terminate your subscription if you fail to promptly pay any outstanding fees.
		</p>

		<h3>
			12.6 Taxes and Fees
		</h3>

		<p>
			You are responsible for all sales, use, value added or other taxes of any kind, other than taxes based on ColdStack’s net income. You are also responsible for any payment-related fees such as wire transfer or Credit Card processing fees.
		</p>

		<h3>
			12.7 Expenses
		</h3>

		<p>
			You are responsible for all fees or expenses related to accessing or using the Services that are extrinsic to the Services. This includes, without limitation, your own internet service provider fees.
